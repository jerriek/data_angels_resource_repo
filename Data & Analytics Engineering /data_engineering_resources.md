## How to add resources to this list
Provide as much information as possible using the categories below for guidance. 
1. **Name of Resource**: Just the name, plain and simple. It’s the first thing people see, so make it clear and easy to spot.

 2. **Type of Resource**: Letting people know whether it’s a book, blog, course, etc., sets the stage for what kind of content they can expect. It helps users figure out how they’ll be engaging with the material.

3. **Who Can Benefit Most From This**: This is about who will get the most out of the resource. Pinpointing an audience (like beginners or experts) helps users quickly see if it’s right for them without having to dig too deep.

4. **Short Description**: Keep it brief and to the point. A quick summary gives the lowdown on what’s inside and what the resource aims to do, which helps users decide if they want to check it out further.

5. **Experience With the Resource**: This is where people can share their own takes on the resource. It’s about what worked, what didn’t, and why someone might find it useful. This real talk can be super helpful for others looking to figure out if it’s worth their time.
